# Dormarr's Rails | Minecraft 1.21

## Overview

**This mod aims to rebalance and update some of the minecart/transport functionality to Minecraft version 1.21.**

### Copper Rails
Given the natural conductance of copper, it seems obvious to use it for rails, if not redstone in general. It's also one material people end up with way too much of and not enough reason to use.
It seems Mojang are looking to push its use as a building block, but I figured we could do something a bit more fun.

The copper rail acts as an intermediary between regular rails and (gold) powered rails. Being cheaper, but slower. I have, however, increased the speed of gold rails dramatically to account for this.
Vanilla rails are just too slow, so gold rails now go at nearly twice the speed as vanilla, while copper go at 80% of this speed. Still quicker than vanilla.

### Amethyst Rails
I initially added these in just as a control for experimenting in the code, but I've grown attached and want to find a good use for them.
Right now, they're the slowest rail, but I want to give them some special ability given how expensive they will be to craft.
If you have any ideas, please let me know!

### Minecart Linking -PENDING
Long overdue in vanilla and present in many mods around already, I at least wanted to try my hand at it.
By right clicking with a vanilla chain (a deeply underutilised block) on two minecarts, they become linked and will act as a kind of train.
I haven't actually begun work on this but it's next on my list once I get the rails sorted.

### Furnace Minecart Tweaks -PENDING
I want to make some adjustments to the furnace minecart, to allow it to accept all kinds of fuel rather than just coal or charcoal.

## Background
I have literally no modding experience. I have spent a lot of time with C#, and Java has been pretty easy to pick up with the same skillset but the Minecraft architecture is wild and I'm still getting used to it. There is no way I'm doing this in a very efficient way, but I really just wanted to create something cool for my own survival worlds and to have a small impact on the modding community.

This is the first in a self directed series of mods I want to make.
